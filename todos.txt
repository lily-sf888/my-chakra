Must Dos
-catch all route that redirects the user back to the homepage
-testing for all the routes
-store all the info user put in chakras, and know how to retrieve it

Nice to haves
-socket.io, show which user is connected

Front End
- click handler on new button
    - attach the current chakra (love, etc) to data object (user.current)
    - attach info collected from form to data object of AJAX request (POST)
    - this will just be one object in the form:
            var love = {
                field1: "text goes here",
                field2: "text goes here",
                field3: "text goes here"
            }
    - then build up a data object to send in the request along the lines of:
            var data = {
                current: user.current, (might have to collect this via a jQuery selector)
                chakra: love (the object we retrieved above)
            }
    
    
    app.get('/mychakras/:chakra', function(req, res) {
        if(!req.user) res.redirect('/login');
        //accessing current chakra page user is on
        chakrasData.current = req.params.chakra;
        //retrieve data from indChakras model (findOne)
        IndChakra.findOne({name: req.user._id}).lean().exec(function (err, mainObj) {
            if (err) console.error(err)
            //attaching user text input for individual chakra
            chakrasData.inputs = mainObj
            
            res.render('pages/chakra.ejs', {user: chakrasData});    
        });
    });
