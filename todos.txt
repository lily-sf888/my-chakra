Must Dos
-catch all route that redirects the user back to the homepage
-testing for all the routes
-store all the info user put in chakras, and know how to retrieve it

Nice to haves
-socket.io, show which user is connected

Front End
- click handler on new button
    - attach the current chakra (love, etc) to data object (user.current)
    - attach info collected from form to data object of AJAX request (POST)
    - this will just be one object in the form:
            var love = {
                field1: "text goes here",
                field2: "text goes here",
                field3: "text goes here"
            }
    - then build up a data object to send in the request along the lines of:
            var data = {
                current: user.current, (might have to collect this via a jQuery selector)
                chakra: love (the object we retrieved above)
            }
    
Back End
- set up new POST route to /update-chakra
    - Use mongoose method, findByIDAndUpdate (use the id from req.user._id)
    - Use this to update the data model for the specified user, so attach the love 
    object we created to the user
    - eg. user.love = { } (the object we have collected)

- on GET request to /mychakras/:chakra
    - retieve all data from req.user (for /love it should be at user.love)
    - use that to populate (.val()) the textareas
